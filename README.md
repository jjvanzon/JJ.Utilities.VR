Quest in this case means: __Meta Quest 2__  
Reverb in the case means: __HP Reverb G2__
Vive in this case means: __HTC Vive Pro 2__

Getting a VR game to run is a hassle just getting all the tooling to start, even more if you have several VR headsets fighting each other on the same PC. These utilities comprise of cmd files that execute command lines to start and stop drivers and tools to get one of the above VR headsets running, as well as shutting down things that may get in the way of the VR performance.

These work on my computer, until the break again. They are meant for my own personal use. I open sourced it all the same, mostly to have some version control on it, in case I make a mistake. Use at your own discretion.
